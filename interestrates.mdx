<Card title="Simple Explanation of Reflect Interest Rates" icon="sparkles" img="https://github.com/palindrome-eng/docs/blob/main/images/docs-rates-image.png?raw=true">
  > Reflect interest rates are calculated in real time by onchain programs and are based entirely on the productivity level of the chosen DeFi strategy. For example: a lower-risk, lower-productivity strategy would be real-world asset rates, such as treasury aggregation, in which the percentage is calculated by the increase in price of the underlying assets.  \
  > \
  > The distribution method of the above model is based entirely around price appreciation, while other models may distribute cash as a method of returning yield to eligible users.

## Distribution Mechanics

<Tip>
  Yield or 'interest rates' are calculated and distributed as often as possible; wherever productivity can be captured, it will be captured. This is a permissionless process and happens entirely onchain.

  <Card title="Price Appreciation" icon="money-bill-trend-up">
    Some DeFi strategies simply pay out by increasing the receipt price over time to match the corresponding amount of assets within their collateral and/or rewards pool, similar to how LSTs increase in value.\
    \
    More redeemable assets = higher receipt price.

  <Card title="Liquid Bonds" icon="money-check-dollar">
    Liquid bonds are simply tokens representing a pool of productive capital, such as USDJ\+ or USDC\+ in the case of Reflect. These Liquid Bonds benefit from price appreciation and the ability to unwrap and claim this appreciation in cash at any moment.

  Below you can visualise the ideal user flow for those who seek to go straight to capturing Interest Rates through strategic stablecoins.

  Switching from non-yield-bearing stablecoins to yield-bearing stablecoins is completely optional. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may want to seek legal counsel before opting to do so.
