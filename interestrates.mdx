  > Reflect Money interest rates are calculated in real time by onchain programs and are based entirely on the productivity level of the chosen DeFi strategy. For example: _A lower-risk, lower-productivity strategy would be real-world asset rates, such as treasury aggregation, in which the percentage is calculated by the increase in price of the underlying assets._  \
  > \
  > The distribution method of the above model is based entirely around price appreciation, while other models may distribute cash as a method of returning yield to eligible users.

## Distribution Mechanics

<Tip>
  Yield or 'interest rates' are calculated and distributed as often as possible; wherever productivity can be captured, it will be captured. <u>This is a permissionless process and happens entirely onchain.</u>

  <Card title="Price Appreciation" icon="money-bill-trend-up" img="https://github.com/palindrome-eng/docs/blob/main/images/docs-bar.png?raw=true">
    Some DeFi strategies simply pay out by increasing the receipt price over time to match the corresponding amount of assets within their collateral and/or rewards pool. _Similar to how LST(s) increase in value._\
    \
    _<u>More redeemable assets = higher receipt price.</u>_

  <Card title="Liquid Bonds" icon="money-check-dollar" img="https://github.com/palindrome-eng/docs/blob/main/images/docs-bar.png?raw=true">
    Liquid bonds are simply tokens representing a pool of productive capital, such as USDJ\+ or USDC\+ in the case of Reflect Money. These Liquid Bonds benefit from <u>Price Appreciation</u> and the ability to unwrap and claim this appreciation in cash at any moment.
