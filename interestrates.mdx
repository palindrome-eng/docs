<Card title="Simple Explanation of Reflect Interest Rates" icon="sparkles" img="images/docs-image-three.png">
  > Reflect Money interest rates are calculated in real-time by onchain programs and are based entirely on the level of productivity of the chosen defi strategy. For example: _a lower risk - lower productivity strategy would be real-world asset rates such as treasuries aggregation in which the (%) is calculated by the increase in price of the underlying assets._  \
  > \
  > The distribution method of the above model is based entirely around price appreciation, while other models may distribute cash as a method of returning yield to eligible users.

## Distribution Mechanics

<Tip>
  Yield or 'Interest Rates' are calculated and distributed as often as possible; \_wherever productivity can be captured, it will be captured. \_<u>This is a permissionless process and happens entirely onchain.</u>

  <Card title="Price Appreciation" icon="money-bill-trend-up" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    Some DeFi strategies simply payout by increasing the receipt price over time to match the corresponding amount of assets within its collateral and or rewards pool. _Similar to how LST(s) increase in value._\
    \
    _<u>More redeemable assets = higher receipt price.</u>_

    Liquid Bonds are simply Tokens representing a pool of productive capital, such as sUSDR or sUSDX in the case of Reflect Money. These Liquid Bonds benefit from <u>Price Appreciation</u> and the ability to unwrap and claim this appreciation in cash at any moment.
