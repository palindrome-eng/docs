## Protecting Deposits via Insurance Fund Mechanics

Reflect Protocol is deeply integrated with its Insurance Fund(s) in a way that is both autonomous and can be validated publicly at any moment. The protocol utilises both a Cash Fund and Validated Restaked Insurance Fund to mitigate risk onboarded by the protocol via deposits.

These funds exist entirely onchain in a way that is both **secure** and _programmatic_ thus allowing the program to process insurance claims in unprecedented speed.

### Minimum Insurance Ratio for Assets Under Management

Reflect Protocol's maximum assets under management (AUM) are directly linked to the total value locked (TVL) in its Insurance Fund(s). This linkage is due to the necessity of maintaining a minimum insurance percentage relative to the deposit cap. In simpler terms, every dollar deposited into Reflect Protocol must be partially insured.

Upon deployment, the protocol has set this insurance ratio at 1:0.2, meaning that for every dollar deposited, 20 cents of insurance must be available. This will initially be funded by the founding org up to 2M USD.

### Boosting Stake Yields by Distributing Protocol Risk at the Personal Level.

Distributed Protocols should reward those who take the most 'productive risk' in which allows for the growth of revenue. In the case of Reflect Protocol insurerers onboard the most risk as the insurance fund acts as the first backstop to any funding rate losses.

Because of this, the protocol is designed in its early stages to distribute a major portion of revenue via the insurance fund. Both in yield distribution and in fund growth. Insurance fund payments will make up 30% of all yield made by the protocol for the first _3 years_ unless modified via governance.

Individuals can opt-in for a portion of this yield, by Restaking their reflectSOL (rSOL) for a given lockup period. Not only will this maintain native yield but it will also earn protocol revenue and decentralization bonds.

<Info>
  The insurance restaking primitive uniquely enables network participants to not only earn Proof of Stake yields from Solana (SOL) but to Stake again (rSOL, other LSTs) in locked periods whereby the reward is both Solana (SOL) and Reflected US Dollars (USDR).

### Operational Policies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cash Fund - Distributed Multi-Signature Wallet Notice." icon="scroll">
    1.0 Purpose:
    The cash fund is established to mitigate potential losses and provide a financial safety net in the event of unforeseen circumstances, such as smart contract exploits, decentralized exchange (DEX) failures, or other operational risks.

    1.2 Multi-Signature Wallet:
    The cash fund is secured using a multi-signature wallet, which is a third-party, formally verified, and extensively audited program. This wallet operates with multiple authorized signatures required to approve any transaction, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access or single-point failures. The multi-signature program has been tested in the field, with existing deposits surpassing billions, providing a high level of assurance regarding its security and reliability.

    2.0 Distributed Custodial Signer Model
    2.1 Structure:
    The multi-signature wallet is managed by a group of custodians, each holding a unique private key. A predefined number of these custodians must collectively sign off on any transaction involving the cash fund. This distributed approach enhances security by ensuring that no single individual or entity has unilateral control over the funds.

    2.2 Key Management:
    Custodians are responsible for the secure storage and management of their private keys. The loss or compromise of a key can impact the ability to access the funds, necessitating robust key management practices and contingency plans.

    3.0 Risks Associated with the Distributed Custodial Signer Model
    3.1 Coordination Risk:
    The multi-signature wallet requires coordination among custodians to authorize transactions. This can introduce delays or complications, particularly in urgent situations where rapid access to funds is necessary. Participants should be aware that the distributed nature of the custodial signer model may affect the speed and efficiency of fund disbursement.

    3.2 Key Compromise Risk:
    While the multi-signature structure mitigates the risk of unauthorized access, the compromise of multiple private keys could still jeopardize the security of the cash fund. Custodians must implement stringent security measures to protect their keys, including the use of hardware wallets, secure storage locations, and regular audits.

    3.3 Custodian Risk:
    The reliability and trustworthiness of custodians are critical to the integrity of the multi-signature wallet. Any failure, misconduct, or collusion among custodians could undermine the security of the cash fund. Rigorous selection and monitoring processes are implemented to ensure custodian reliability, but participants should be aware of this inherent risk.

    3.4 Technical Risk:
    The multi-signature wallet relies on underlying smart contract technology to function. Any vulnerabilities, bugs, or exploits within the smart contract could impact the operation of the wallet. Despite extensive security audits and testing, participants must recognize the potential for technical risks.

    3.5 Regulatory Risk:
    The legal and regulatory environment for multi-signature wallets and distributed custodial models is still evolving. Changes in regulations or legal challenges could impact the operation and legality of the cash fund. Participants should be aware that regulatory developments could influence the availability and management of the fund.

    4.0 Mitigation Measures
    4.1 Security Audits:
    Regular security audits of the multi-signature smart contract and overall infrastructure are conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. These audits are performed by reputable third-party security firms.

    4.2 Redundancy and Backup:
    Custodians are required to implement redundancy and backup measures for their private keys to ensure accessibility in the event of key loss or compromise. This includes secure backup locations and encrypted storage solutions.

    4.3 Governance and Oversight:
    Governance protocols are established to oversee the management and operation of the cash fund. This includes regular reviews, audits, and compliance checks to ensure adherence to best practices and to mitigate risks.

    4.4 Incident Response Plan:
    A comprehensive incident response plan is in place to address potential security breaches or operational failures. This plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a key compromise, smart contract exploit, or other critical incidents to minimize impact and restore normal operations.

    Conclusion
    The Reflect Delta-Neutral Protocol's cash fund, managed through a distributed custodial signer model utilizing a third-party, formally verified multi-signature wallet, provides an essential layer of security. While this model enhances security and mitigates single-point failures, it also introduces specific risks that participants must understand. These include coordination risk, key compromise risk, custodian risk, technical risk, and regulatory risk.

  <Accordion title="Cash Fund - Operational Principles for Custodial Signers." icon="scroll">
    This document outlines the operational principles governing the use of the cash fund, ensuring transparency, accountability, and adherence to best practices. These principles are designed to inform all stakeholders about the protocols and procedures that multi-signature (multisig) signers must follow when managing the cash fund.

    1.0 Purpose and Scope of the Cash Fund
    1.1 Primary Function:
    The cash fund is strictly designated to rectify losses and address market discrepancies if such situations arise. The primary purpose is to protect against unforeseen events that could result in financial loss, such as smart contract exploits, decentralized exchange (DEX) failures, or significant negative funding rate events.

    1.2 Operational Flexibility:
    While the primary function of the cash fund is loss rectification and market stabilization, operators are permitted to utilize up to 40% of the total cash fund in low-risk, permissionless, on-chain earning opportunities. These opportunities must be strictly low-risk, and funds must be retrievable at any moment without restriction, ensuring they remain readily available for their primary purpose.

    1. Governance and Community Consultation
       2.1 Asset Allocation Adjustments:
       Should there be a need to adjust the percentage weights of assets within the cash fund, including the portion allocated to earning opportunities, signers are required to consult the Reflect community. This consultation should be conducted transparently, utilizing decentralized voting mechanisms whenever feasible, to ensure that any changes reflect the consensus of the community.

    2.2 Community Engagement:
    Signers must actively engage with the community, providing detailed proposals and rationales for any suggested changes to the asset composition of the cash fund, including the use of funds for earning opportunities. This engagement process is critical for maintaining trust and ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of all stakeholders.

    1. Reporting and Transparency
       3.1 Monthly Updates:
       Signers are obligated to provide routine updates on the status of the cash fund, including details on the portion deployed in earning opportunities, historical funding rates, and proof of reserves snapshots. These updates should be published every month, with a maximum interval of 31 days between reports. This regular reporting ensures transparency and allows stakeholders to monitor the fund's status and performance.

    3.2 Public Disclosures:
    All reports and updates must be publicly accessible, providing stakeholders with clear, accurate, and comprehensive information about the cash fund's operations and status, including the specific earning strategies employed and their associated risks.

    1. Prohibition of Personal Gain
       4.1 Strict Prohibition:
       The cash fund is strictly not for personal gain or for the benefit of any individual or group. It is intended solely as a financial backstop to protect against losses and market discrepancies. Any attempt to use the fund for personal enrichment or other unauthorized purposes is strictly prohibited and subject to disciplinary action.

    4.2 Conflict of Interest:
    Signers must avoid any conflict of interest when managing the cash fund. All decisions and actions, including those related to earning opportunities, must prioritize the fund's primary purpose of providing financial security and stability for the protocol.

    1. Multisig Signer Protocols
       5.1 Signature Announcements:
       Signers must publicly announce each time a signature is made on the multisig wallet. These announcements should include the purpose of the transaction, the amount involved, and the signatures obtained. This transparency is crucial for maintaining trust and accountability.

    5.2 Approval Process:
    All transactions involving the cash fund, including those related to earning opportunities, must follow a rigorous approval process, requiring multiple signatures from authorized custodians. This process ensures that no single individual can unilaterally access or manipulate the funds, providing an additional layer of security.

    1. Additional Legal and Operational Considerations
       6.1 Compliance with Regulatory Requirements:
       Signers must ensure that all activities related to the cash fund comply with relevant regulatory requirements. This includes maintaining proper records, conducting regular audits, and adhering to any reporting obligations.

    6.2 Security Measures:
    Signers are required to implement and maintain robust security measures to protect the cash fund. This includes secure key management practices, regular security audits, and immediate action in response to any identified vulnerabilities or breaches.

    6.3 Incident Response:
    In the event of an incident that impacts the cash fund, signers must promptly implement the incident response plan. This plan should include measures to mitigate losses, investigate the cause of the incident, and communicate transparently with stakeholders about the actions being taken.

    Conclusion
    The Operational Principles for the Use of the Cash Fund are designed to ensure the responsible, transparent, and effective management of the fund. By adhering to these principles, signers help safeguard the Reflect Delta-Neutral Protocol from potential financial risks while allowing for prudent low-risk earning opportunities. All stakeholders are encouraged to review these principles carefully and engage in upholding the integrity and security of the decentralized ecosystem.
