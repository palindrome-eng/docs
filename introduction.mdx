## What is Reflect Money?

Reflect Money is <u>Spinal-Level</u> Financial Infrastructure for onchain capital efficiency through permissionless and programmable intermediation - its systems enable users and developers to capture the productivity of any onchain monetary expanse seamlessly without dealing with centralised parties, human-operated risk management, etc.

Financial Intermediation in the blockchain industry has traditionally been centralised, operated by closed-source, human-reliant systems that don't scale to meet the growing monetary expansion of onchain environments such as DeFi, thus leading to massive capital inefficiency and a major segmentation of available capital. Reflect solves this through transparent, <u>programmatic</u> money that anyone can issue and redeem **backed entirely by onchain DeFi strategy.**

### Core Components of Reflect Money

<u>Reflect Money</u> _is comprised of three foundational level systems, which can be found below:_

  <Card title="Tokenisation" icon="coins" iconType="regular" color="#00ff00">
    Tokenisation refers to the act of representing something (_an object, financial product or fungible asset_) on a public blockchain as a 'Token' which is tradeable and transferrable amongst accounts. In the case of Reflect it is tokenising deposits in its <u>strategies.</u>

  <Card title="Decentralized Financial Strategy" icon="layer-group" iconType="regular" color="#00ff00">
    Financial Strategies such as _lending, asset diversification, basis trades, money markets_ and more can all be taken advantage of onchain today at the <u>cost of opportunity</u> i.e. _your deposit mostly stays with the program in which you deposit._ Reflect builds programs to match the most effective onchain financial strategies where your deposit is tokenised in stablecoin format, equalling zero opportunity cost.

  <Card title="Verifiable Insurance" icon="shield-check" iconType="regular" color="#00ff00">
    Every tokenised DeFi strategy _(Stablecoin)_ issued by Reflect Programs is coupled with its own unique insurance program, which allows for the automation of insurance claims through verifiable consensus on attestations - it achieves this through means of zk and restaking for economic security and capitalisation.
