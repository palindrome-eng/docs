## Decentralized Financial Intermediation (DeFI)

Reflect Money is <u>Spinal-Level</u> Financial Infrastructure for onchain capital efficiency through permissionless and programmable intermediation - its systems enable users and developers to capture the productivity of any onchain monetary expanse seamlessly without dealing with centralised parties, human operated risk management etc.

Financial Intermediation in the blockchain financial sector has traditionally been centralised, operated by closed-source, human reliant systems that dont scale to meet the growing monetary expansion of onchain environments, thus leading to massive capital inefficiency and a major segmentation of available capital. Reflect solves this through transparent, <u>programmatic</u> money that anyone can issue and redeem \*\*backed entirely by onchain productivity. \*\*

### Core Components of Reflect Money

Reflect is built upon decentralized onchain programs and verifiable infrastructure to maximise security alongside automation and remove the need for human interference.

    Reflect Money allows users and developers to issue and redeem many types of US Dollars backed by the monetary expanse (onchain productivity) and collateralisation model of their choice. _examples of this include perpetual open interest etc._

  <Card title="Issue & Redemption Programs" icon="building-columns" iconType="regular" color="#3f99ff">
    The supply and redemption of stablecoins via Reflect is entirely managed by onchain programs deployed with purpose designed economic models based on the monetary expansion it is tokenising. All collateral assets are held non-custodially by program accounts and managed and rebalanced permissionlessly where required.

  <Card title="Verifiable Insurance Programs" icon="shield" iconType="regular" color="#3f99ff">
    Every tokenised money expanse issued by Reflect Programs is coupled with its own unique insurance program which allows for the automation of insurance claims through verifiable consensus on attestations - it achieves this through means of restaking for economic security and capitalization.

    Reflect Money tracks the Monetary Expanse of SVM Networks and maintains an index rate which indicates the total size of productivity available at any one moment. \_It is due to be published in 2025 as a public reference point for fundamentals analysis. \_
