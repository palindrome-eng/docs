## What is Reflect Money?

Reflect is Software-as-a-Stablecoin, where the software consists of decentralized financial strategies executed and managed permissionlessly by programs rather than humans. Reflect tokenizes these strategies in the form of interest-bearing US Dollars (stablecoins).

<Accordion title="Get a Deeper Understanding" description="A more technical shortform explanation for what Reflect Money is." icon="book">
  Reflect Money is <u>Spinal-Level</u> Financial Infrastructure for onchain capital efficiency through permissionless and programmable intermediationâ€”its systems enable users and developers to capture the productivity of any onchain monetary expanse seamlessly without dealing with centralized parties, human-operated risk management, etc.

  Financial intermediation in the blockchain industry has traditionally been centralized, operated by closed-source, human-reliant systems that don't scale to meet the growing monetary expansion of onchain environments such as DeFi. This has led to massive capital inefficiency and significant segmentation of available capital. Reflect solves this through transparent, <u>strategic</u> money that anyone can issue and redeem, **backed entirely by onchain DeFi strategy.**

### Core Components of Reflect Money

<u>Reflect Money</u> _comprises three foundational-level systems, which are described below:_

  <Card title="Tokenization" icon="coins" iconType="regular" img="https://github.com/palindrome-eng/docs/blob/main/images/docs-bar.png?raw=true">
    Tokenization refers to the act of representing something (an object, financial product, or fungible asset) on a public blockchain as a 'token' that is tradable and transferable among accounts. In the case of Reflect, it is tokenizing deposits in its strategies.

    Financial strategies such as _lending, asset diversification, basis trades, money markets_ and more can all be taken advantage of onchain today at the cost of opportunity, i.e., your deposit mostly stays with the program in which you deposit. Reflect builds programs to match the most effective onchain financial strategies where your deposit is tokenized in stablecoin format, resulting in zero opportunity cost.

    Every tokenized DeFi strategy (stablecoin) issued by Reflect Programs is coupled with its own unique insurance program, which allows for the automation of insurance claims through verifiable consensus on attestations. It achieves this through the use of zk and restaking for economic security and capitalization.
