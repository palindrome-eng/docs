**A Suite of Dollars Built on Code, Not Promises.**

Reflect is a new kind of stablecoin issuer that runs on open, neutral rules rather than human decisions.

We have built a system where digital dollars are backed by insured, income-generating strategies. Because the system is managed by programs—not people—it is faster, cheaper, and completely transparent. You get US Dollar tokens that **automatically earn** interest, with the peace of mind that comes from a system designed to be fair and open from the ground up.

### Income-Generating Dollars

To fit different _risk profiles_ and needs, Reflect provides a choice of income-bearing dollars that all benefit from our insurance token:
