United States Dollar Coin Plus (USDC+) is an optimally efficient version of the [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) stablecoin provided by [Circle (CRCL)](https://circle.com), a publicly traded US company. It produces efficiency and interest rates through a lender/borrower-based strategy.

### Operational Strategy

Here you will find a description of the financial intermediation strategy utilised by onchain programs in order to maximise the interest rate of its USDC collateral.

**The Capital Supplier Methodology**

The Capital Supplier strategy is one of the simplest and safest ways to generate interest onchain. It works by supplying your USDC to overcollateralised lending pools, where borrowers pay interest to access liquidity.

<Steps>
  <Step title="USDC is Deposited">
    USDC is sent to the Reflect program, which holds all deposits in a non-custodial pool that no human can access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Best Rates are Found">
    The program scans Solana's top lending markets to find where USDC can earn the highest interest rates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="USDC is Put to Work">
    USDC is automatically distributed across trusted lending platforms like [Drift](https://drift.trade), [Kamino](https://kamino.com), and [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/lend/earn) to capture the best available rates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="USDC+ is Issued">
    Depositors receive USDC+ tokens representing their share of the pool. Because the pool earns interest, 1 USDC+ is worth slightly more than 1 USDC and grows over time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collateral Grows">
    As interest accumulates, the value of USDC+ increases. It can be converted back to USDC anytime to claim earnings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Strategic Value Propositions

USDC+ is designed to provide a familiar, safe, and low risk-tolerance yield-bearing asset for use within financial applications requiring interest rates on their stablecoin balances.

  <Card title="Reduction in Margin Costs">
    By providing USDC to all prominent lending venues Reflect is lowering the cost of margin for cash which encourages more volume.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prevent Impermanent Loss">
    By adding a native interest rate to Solana's largest liquidity pair token you can reduce impermanent loss faced on one side of the pool.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Increase in Available Margin">
    Reflect provides cash-capital to money markets over a longer time-horizon and therefore increases the available size of lending for these markets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Earn During Settlement">
    USDC is a payments-powerhouse but lacks the ability to be intermediated during payment-settlement periods. USDC+ enables low-risk value capture on this period.

### Risk Modeling Cross-Margin Strategies

Integrators should understand the composite risk profile when deploying USDC+ within their applications, as the strategy inherits risks from all underlying lending venues.

**Primary Risk Considerations**

Since USDC+ distributes capital across multiple borrow/lend markets, the risk profile combines individual protocol exposures with cross-margin strategy considerations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Protocol Security Risk">
    Each lending venue carries distinct smart contract risks, audit histories, and security track records that compound across the strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Liquidity & LTV Variance">
    Different protocols maintain varying Loan-to-Value ratios and withdrawal capacities that may affect liquidity during market stress.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Key Risk Factors for Integration:**

- Multi-venue exposure: Smart contract risks compound across all active lending protocols
- Liquidity constraints: Withdrawal capacity dependent on utilization rates across venues
- Yield volatility: Interest rates fluctuate based on market conditions and cross-venue competition
- Venue concentration: Capital allocation methodology may create dependencies on specific protocols

<Info>
  Integrators should treat USDC+ as a higher-risk asset compared to native USDC and implement appropriate user disclosures regarding multi-venue exposure and inherited protocol risks.
