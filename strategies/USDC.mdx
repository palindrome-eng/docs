### The Efficiency Strategy for Money Markets

United States Dollar Coin Plus (**_USDC\+_**) is an optimally efficient version of the [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) stablecoin provided by [Circle (CRCL)](circle.com) a publicly traded US company. It produces efficiency and interest-rates through a lender/borrower based strategy.

<Info>
  Reflect Money is a [_Member of the Circle Alliance_](https://partners.circle.com/partner/reflect-money) - a program by Circle to combine the best operators who wish to scale the use of its digital cash.

### Operational Strategy

_Here you will find a description of the financial intermediation strategy utilised by onchain programs in order to maximise the interest-rate of its USDC collateral._

**<u>The Capital Supplier Methodology</u>**

The Capital Supplier strategy is one of the simplest and safest interest-rate generating strategies available on public ledger networks as it utilises highly-liquid cash assets to farm interest-rates on overcollateralised lending/margin pools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="USDC is Deposited.">
    _USDC is sent by users or developers to the distributor program, which acts as a non-custodial pool for all collateral assets._
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distributor Calculates Rates">
    _The distributor program calcultes the best interest-rates at X size for USDC on the network and marks what venues can host up to how much liquidity._
  </Step>
  <Step title="USDC is Distributed">
    _The program then distributes this USDC immediately in order to capture interest-rates from leverage markets or borrow/lend pools._
  </Step>
  <Step title="USDC+ is Issued">
    _Depositors receive USDC\+ equivalent to their share in the pool i.e. 1 USDC can equal 0.975 USDC\+ similar to liquid staked tokens._
  </Step>
  <Step title="USDC+ collateral grows">
    _The value of USDC\+ in USDC grows and appreciation in this can be claimed by unwrapping the USDC\+ token to its native form._
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Strategic Value Propositions

USDC\+ is designed to provide a familiar, safe and low risk-tolerance yield-bearing asset for use within financial applications requiring interest-rates on its stablecoin balances. _More information about its primary value propositons can be found below._

  <Card title="Reduction in Margin Costs" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    By providing USDC to all prominent lending venues Reflect is lowering the cost of margin for cash which encourages more volume.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prevent Impermanent Loss" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    By adding a native interest rate to SVMs largest liquidity pair token you can reduce impermanent loss faced on one side of the pool.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Increase in Available Margin" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    Reflect provides cash-capital to money markets over a longer time-horizon and therefore increases the available size of lending for these markets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Earn During Settlement" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    USDC is a payments-powerhouse but lacks the ability to be intermediated during payment-settlement periods. USDC\+ enables low-risk value capture on this period.
  </Card>

### Risk Modeling Cross-Margin Strategies

_Integrators should understand the composite risk profile when deploying USDC\+ within their applications, as the strategy inherits risks from all underlying lending venues._

**<u>Primary Risk Considerations</u>**

Since USDC\+ distributes capital across multiple borrow/lend markets, the risk profile combines individual protocol exposures with cross-margin strategy considerations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Protocol Security Risk" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    Each lending venue carries distinct smart contract risks, audit histories, and security track records that compound across the strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Liquidity & LTV Variance" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    Different protocols maintain varying Loan-to-Value ratios and withdrawal capacities that may affect liquidity during market stress.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Key Risk Factors for Integration:**

- **Multi-venue exposure**: Smart contract risks compound across all active lending protocols
- **Liquidity constraints**: Withdrawal capacity dependent on utilization rates across venues
- **Yield volatility**: Interest rates fluctuate based on market conditions and cross-venue competition
- **Venue concentration**: Capital allocation methodology may create dependencies on specific protocols

<Info>
  Integrators should treat USDC\+ as a higher-risk asset compared to native USDC and implement appropriate user disclosures regarding multi-venue exposure and inherited protocol risks.
