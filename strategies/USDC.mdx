United States Dollar Coin Plus (USDC+) is an optimally efficient version of the [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) stablecoin provided by [Circle (CRCL)](https://circle.com), a publicly traded US company. It produces efficiency and interest rates through a lender/borrower-based strategy.

### Operational Strategy

Here you will find a description of the financial intermediation strategy utilised by onchain programs in order to maximise the interest rate of its USDC collateral.

**The Capital Supplier Methodology**

The Capital Supplier strategy is one of the simplest and safest interest-rate-generating strategies available on public ledger networks as it utilises highly-liquid cash assets to farm interest rates on overcollateralised lending/margin pools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="USDC is Deposited">
    USDC is sent by users or developers to the distributor program, which acts as a non-custodial pool for all collateral assets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distributor Calculates Rates">
    The distributor program calculates the best interest rates at X size for USDC on the network and marks what venues can host up to how much liquidity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="USDC is Distributed">
    The program then distributes this USDC immediately in order to capture interest rates from margin markets or borrow/lend pools such as [Drift](https://drift.trade), [Kamino](https://kamino.com), and [Jupiter (Fluid)](https://jup.ag/lend/earn).
  </Step>
  <Step title="USDC+ is Issued">
    Depositors receive USDC+ equivalent to their share in the pool, i.e., 1 USDC can equal 0.975 USDC+, similar to liquid staked tokens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="USDC+ Collateral Grows">
    The value of USDC+ in USDC grows and appreciation in this can be claimed by unwrapping the USDC+ token to its native form.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Strategic Value Propositions

USDC+ is designed to provide a familiar, safe, and low risk-tolerance yield-bearing asset for use within financial applications requiring interest rates on their stablecoin balances.

  <Card title="Reduction in Margin Costs">
    By providing USDC to all prominent lending venues Reflect is lowering the cost of margin for cash which encourages more volume.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prevent Impermanent Loss">
    By adding a native interest rate to Solana's largest liquidity pair token you can reduce impermanent loss faced on one side of the pool.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Increase in Available Margin">
    Reflect provides cash-capital to money markets over a longer time-horizon and therefore increases the available size of lending for these markets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Earn During Settlement">
    USDC is a payments-powerhouse but lacks the ability to be intermediated during payment-settlement periods. USDC+ enables low-risk value capture on this period.
  </Card>

### Risk Modeling Cross-Margin Strategies

Integrators should understand the composite risk profile when deploying USDC+ within their applications, as the strategy inherits risks from all underlying lending venues.

**Primary Risk Considerations**

Since USDC+ distributes capital across multiple borrow/lend markets, the risk profile combines individual protocol exposures with cross-margin strategy considerations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Protocol Security Risk">
    Each lending venue carries distinct smart contract risks, audit histories, and security track records that compound across the strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Liquidity & LTV Variance">
    Different protocols maintain varying Loan-to-Value ratios and withdrawal capacities that may affect liquidity during market stress.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Key Risk Factors for Integration:**

- Multi-venue exposure: Smart contract risks compound across all active lending protocols
- Liquidity constraints: Withdrawal capacity dependent on utilization rates across venues
- Yield volatility: Interest rates fluctuate based on market conditions and cross-venue competition
- Venue concentration: Capital allocation methodology may create dependencies on specific protocols

<Info>
  Integrators should treat USDC+ as a higher-risk asset compared to native USDC and implement appropriate user disclosures regarding multi-venue exposure and inherited protocol risks.
