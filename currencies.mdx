### Decentralised Finance _Strategies:_

The engineering team behind [reflect.money](http://reflect.money) is constantly e_valuating, researching and implementing_ potential new financial strategies that can be used in all market sectors as yield-bearing stablecoins. 

<CardGroup cols="1">
  <Card title="Delta-Neutral Funding Rate Capture" icon="chart-simple">
    This strategy utilises a single-sided delta-neutral trade whereby productive capital is deposited by users or integrated programs and the equal dollar value amount short position is opened against the likewise asset. i.e. if a user deposits 100\$ of SOL then 100\$ of SOL is shorted to create a zero delta position. \
    \
    This removes the exposure to price risk, i.e. _price going up and down_ - and instead <u>increases exposure to the funding rate</u> - a cash settled payment which helps to balance the pricing of the markets, this payment can be determined to be the yield and or potential loss of this strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delta-Neutral Cross Margin Rate Capture" icon="chart-mixed">
    This strategy utilises a double-sided delta-neutral trade whereby collateral is converted to cash upon deposit and used to place a trade on both sides of the same market at an identical strike price. This removes exposure to price and funding rate and increases exposure to cross-margin capital demands. \
    \
    Cross-margin capital rates are determined by how many people are leverage trading across all markets on the perpetual exchange. This demand to trade increases the demand for cash and thus increases the yield paid to those who deposit cash into the markets.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where does the Interest (yield) come from?" icon="circle-question">
    **Interest rates or "yields" are generated via the productivity of the relevant DeFi Strategy** - for example, in the case of USDJ our single-sided delta-neutral token the yield is generated by those paying funding rates to leverage long SOL-USD. _In the case of other stablecoins this will vary._
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is the collateral in the program(s) insured?" icon="circle-question">
    **Yes.** Reflect Protocol operates both a **hard cash insurance fund** and multiple **Restaked Validated Services** that offload protocol risk to network stakers in exchange for a portion of the revenue from each specific DeFi strategy that is tokenized.
