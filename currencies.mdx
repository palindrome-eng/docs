### Decentralised Finance _Strategies:_

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Delta-Neutral Funding Rate Capture" icon="chart-simple" color="#00ff00" img="/images/docs-usdr-bar.png">
    This strategy utilises a single-sided delta-neutral trade whereby productive capital is deposited by users or integrated programs and the equal dollar value amount short position is opened against the likewise asset. _i.e. if a user deposits 100\$ of SOL then 100\$ of SOL is shorted to create a zero delta position. _\
    \
    This removes the exposure to price risk, i.e. _price going up and down_ - and instead <u>increases exposure to the funding rate</u> - a cash settled payment which helps to balance the pricing of the markets, this payment can be determined to be the yield and or potential loss of this strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delta-Neutral Cross Margin Rate Capture" icon="chart-mixed" color="#00ff00" img="/images/docs-usdx-bar.png">
    This strategy utilises a double-sided delta-neutral trade whereby collateral is converted to cash upon deposit and used to place a trade on both sides of the same market at an identical strike price. This removes exposure to price and funding rate and increases exposure to cross-margin capital demands. \
    \
    Cross-margin capital rates are determined by how many people are leverage trading across all markets on the perpetual exchange. _This demand to trade increases the demand for cash and thus increases the yield paid to those who deposit cash into the markets. _

### _Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)_

<br />

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are their any Mint/Redeem fees?" icon="circle-question">
    **No**, there are zero fees when minting or redeeming Strategic Stablecoins. _Depending on the strategy chosen, there may be a temporary arb hold percentage._
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is the price of Reflected Currencies made to be stable?" icon="circle-question">
    **Reflect issued stablecoins have in-built stability mechanisms like rebalancing, debt-settlement and more within its onchain programs.** They can be called permissionlessly and automatically allowing for the maximum frequency of attestation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where does the Interest (yield) come from?" icon="circle-question">
    **Interest rates or "yields" are generated via the productivity of the relevant DeFi Strategy** - for example, in the case of USDR our single-sided delta-neutral token the yield is generated by those paying funding rates to leverage long SOL-USD. _In the case of other stablecoins this will vary._
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is the collateral in the program(s) insured?" icon="circle-question">
    **Yes.** Reflect Protocol operates both a **hard cash insurance fund** and multiple **Restaked Validated Services** that _offloads_ protocol risk to network stakers in exchange for a portion of revenue of each specific defi strategy which is tokenised.
