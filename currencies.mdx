### How Reflect issued stablecoins are created:

Reflect allows for the creation of many types of stablecoins according to the collateral and backing model sought by the depositor - in the example shown below, a user is seeking USDR a higher risk beta to perpetual open interest which typically returns a high interest rate - <u>to mint, they are depositing one of the accepted LST(s) as collateral in return for the stablecoin. </u>

### How Redeeming Reflect issued stablecoins works:

Redemption of Reflect issued stablecoins is relatively simple depending on the tokenised money expanse used - in the above example the user has minted USDR with LST(s) which in order to redeem they would simply burn the USDR via the Reflect Single-Sided Delta-Neutral program to receive the equivalent dollar value of LST(s) back.

<Info>
  Redemption of USDR and the subsequent withdrawals of LSTs is an instant atomic process. _There is no wait period to receive collateral from the protocol._
