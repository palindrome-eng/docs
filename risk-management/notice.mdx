### Active risk prevention through consensus based insurance

**Reflect Money actively prevents risk events facing its collateral** via <u>autonomous consensus</u> - _this can otherwise be described as groups of authorized nodes who are operating a software-based data collection service_ that aids in identifying the moments an insurance claim is needed. Once these nodes agree that a claim is required they can automatically run this process on-chain, ensuring minimal collateral downtime and the smallest possible losses.
