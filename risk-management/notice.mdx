### Types of risk facing digital financial products

<Info>
  Be Aware: When utilizing financial primitives online, it is paramount to be comfortable with personal management of operational and economic security and understand all of the risks associated with such a product. If you are unsure or uncertain in any way in how to approach Reflect assets then please consult with your financial advisor.

  <Card title="Smart Contract Risk" icon="file-code">
    The public and permissionless nature of smart contracts means they are often targets of cyber theft. This is an inherent risk when depositing funds on a public blockchain.

    **Prevention:** Code & Economic Audits

    **Elimination:** Global Insurance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Exchange Risk" icon="shuffle">
    Reflect utilizes onchain DEXs to enable some of its strategy-backed products to be capitally efficient. This means onboarding all of the risks associated with these exchanges.
    **Prevention:** Use of Insured DEXs

    **Elimination:** Global Insurance

  <Card title="Interest Rate Risk" icon="percent">
    Although Reflect's insurance systems cover 100% of all principal deposits, the rates provided by each strategy are not guaranteed and have their own inherent risks such as money market fund rate changes, funding rate swings, etc.

    **Prevention:** Economic Strategy Audits

    **Elimination:** Fallbacks in Strategies

  <Card title="Collateral Risk" icon="sack-dollar">
    Reflect utilises assets issued onchain as collateral for its strategies and therefore inherits risks associated with centralised and decentralised issuers of tokens.
    **Prevention:** Asset Classification

    **Elimination:** Limitation to S Tier

### Key knowledge for understanding the Reflect risk framework

The Reflect risk framework is a four-step solution for ensuring S-Tier collateral assets issued onchain can be deployed to the most secure and effective financial strategy while simultaneously being tokenised as stablecoins through intermediation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Asset Classification" icon="money-check" iconType="regular" titleSize="p">
    A systematic approach to defining the validity of an asset for use as collateral in Reflect's issuing strategies.

    <Accordion title="More information on asset classification" icon="info">
      Reflect utilises a stringent classification process for assets issued on public ledgers whereby the classification rating will correspond to how safe and or valid a specific token is for use as collateral within one of our strategies. Typically this classification involves scoring liquidity provisions, issuer reliability and legality, how available this asset is across exchanges and networks and more. \
      \
      The classification system utilises ratings from A to E whereby the higher index of alphabetical letters is a lower rating. For assets to achieve classification under the Reflect guidelines, they undergo a rigorous 14-day audit process. At this time we do not accept requests to classify assets on behalf of others.

      <Info>
        The full list of classified assets is not currently available for public viewing and is expected to go live by Q4 2025.

  <Step title="Economic Security Audits (ESA)" icon="shield">
    Academic thesis-driven simulation, backtesting and scrutiny of strategies implemented for the creation of new stablecoins.

    <Accordion title="More information on economic security audits" icon="info">
      Economic Security Audits (ESAs) are employed by Reflect in order to ensure that financial strategies designed by its teams are not only sound, secure, and scalable but also function as expected in extreme scenarios or "black swan" events. Reflect undergoes these audits via the use of third-party organisations specializing in the academic and financial verification of financial strategy.

      These audits are exclusive from a code-security audit and explicitly highlight the functionality, scalability, backtesting results and simulation outcomes of onchain financial strategy and are not inclusive of information pertaining to the security of code operating said strategy.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Code Security Audits (CSA)" icon="gear">
    Rigorous exploitation, penetration and security-practice audits from reputable third-party research vendors.

    <Accordion title="More information on code security audits" icon="info">
      Code Security Audits (CSAs) are employed by Reflect in order to ensure and verify its programs deployed to public ledgers follow industry-leading security practices and therefore can provide guarantees for deposits into financial strategies operated by Reflect.

      CSAs follow a rigorous process of discovering vulnerabilities and potential exploits, and work with the engineers to fix, nullify, and defend against all types of attacks. These audits are carried out by third-party research organisations with expertise in the auditing of onchain financial code.

      <Info>
        A full list of CSAs pertaining to the programs of Reflect can be found on the page of its respective strategies. All reports are also available through the PalindromeEng GitHub organisation.

  <Step title="Global Insurance" icon="globe">
    A first-in-industry autonomous insurance protocol powered by consensus networks and restaking pools.

    <Accordion title="More information on global insurance" icon="info">
      Reflect's Global Insurance is akin to FSCS offered on bank accounts and acts as a native insurance layer to protect the principal deposits placed within its strategic stablecoins.

      It is designed to function like a universal liquidity pool for all assets that underlie Reflect-based strategies, allowing for feeless rebalancing across strategies with no slippage, MEV, or vampiric loss. Liquidity is added to this pool via the use of restaking, a network-security primitive that allows proof-of-stake assets to be reused in the validation of alternative services.

      Restaking is used to enable consensus-based automation on Reflect Strategy Programs. For example, when restaked nodes come to consensus that one strategy is missing X dollars, then we can automatically refill this deposit to ensure minimal collateral downtime. This system is up to 4000x more efficient than human-operated strategy rebalancing.

      The claims process is entirely automated thanks to the above consensus system, meaning depositors and developers need not worry about principal deposits and can instead maximise their choice of strategy in return for yield.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Active risk prevention through consensus-based insurance

Reflect actively prevents risk events facing its collateral via autonomous consensus - groups of authorized nodes operating a software-based data collection service that identifies when an insurance claim is needed. Once these nodes agree that a claim is required they can automatically run this process onchain, ensuring minimal collateral downtime and the smallest possible losses.

**Global Insurance (How it Works)**

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Powered by Restaking" icon="spa">
    Reflect's Global Insurance pool is powered by Restaked Assets, allowing users to secure their Layer-1 blockchain by staking and earn real-time cash income by securing stablecoins.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automated by Consensus" icon="gear">
    To maximise transparency and minimise insurance pool losses all claims are handled through consensus nodes with access to all data relevant to Reflect strategies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Attestations in Real Time" icon="clock">
    Insurance nodes post public attestations every 450 milliseconds of all data they have collected and the calculated risk score and claims status. This allows developers and users to model risk in real time.
