### Types of risk facing digital financial products.

<Info>
  _Be Aware | When utilizing financial primitives online, it is paramount to be comfortable with personal management of operational and economic security and understand all of the risks associated with such a product. If you are unsure or uncertain in any way in how to approach reflect assets then please consult with your financial advisor._

  <Card title="Smart Contract Risk" icon="file-code" color="#00ff00" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    the public & permissionless nature of smart contracts means they are often targets of cyber theft. This is an inherent risk when depositing funds on a public blockchain.

### Key knowledge for understanding the reflect risk framework.

The reflect risk framework is a **four-step solution** for ensuring S-Tier collateral assets issued on-chain can be deployed to the most secure and effective financial strategy while simulteanously being tokenised as stablecoins through intermediation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Asset Classification" icon="money-check" iconType="regular" titleSize="p">
    _A systematic approach to defining the validity of an asset for use as collateral in reflect(s) issuing strategies._

    <Accordion title="more information on asset classification" icon="info">
      Reflect utilises a stringent classification process for assets issued on public ledgers whereby the classification rating will correspond to how safe and or valid a specific token is for use as collateral within one of our strategies. Typically this classification involves scoring liquidity provisions, issuer reliability and legality, how available this asset is across exchanges and networks and more. \
      \
      The classification system utilises ratings **from A to E** whereby the higher index of alphabetical letters is a lower rating. For assets to achieve classification under the Reflect guidelines they undergo a rigorous 14 day audit process. _At this time we do not accept requests to classify assets on behalf of others._

      <Info>
        \_The full list of classified assets is not currently available for public viewing and is expected to go live by Q4 2025. \_

  </Step>
  <Step title="Economic Security Audits (ESA)" icon="shield">
    _Academic thesis driven simulation, backtesting and scrutiny of strategies implemented for the creation of new stablecoins._

    <Accordion title="more information on economic security audits" icon="info">
      Economic Security Audits (ESA)'s are employed by Reflect in order to ensure that financial strategy designed by its teams are not only sound, secure and scalable but also function as expected in extrenuous scenarios or "black swan" events. Reflect undergoes these audits via the use of third-party organisations specializing in the academic and financial verification of financial strategy.

      These audits are exclusive from a code-security audit and explicitly highlight the functionality, scalability, backtesting results and simulation outcomes of onchain financial strategy and are not inclusive of information pertaining to the security of code operating said strategy.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Code Security Audits (CSA)" icon="gear">
    _Rigorous exploitation, penetration and security-practice audits from reputable third-party research vendors._

    <Accordion title="more information on code security audits" icon="info">
      Code Security Audits (CSA)s are employed by Reflect in order to ensure and verify its programs deployed to public ledgers follow industry-leading security practices and therefore can provide guarantees for deposits into financial strategies operated by Reflect.

      CSA's follow a rigorous process of discovering vulnerabilities, potential exploits and work with the engineers to fix, nullify and defend against all types of attacks - These audits are carried out by third-party research organisations with expertise in the auditing of onchain financial code.

      <Info>
        _A full list of CSA's pertaining to the programs of Reflect Money can be found on the page of its respective strategies. All reports are also available through the PalindromeEng github organisation._

  <Step title="Global Insurance" icon="globe">
    _A first-in-industry autonomous insurance protocol powered by consensus networks and restaking pools._

    <Accordion title="more information on global insurance" icon="info">
      Reflect(s) Global Insurance is **akin to FSCS** offered on bank-accounts and acts as a native insurance layer to protect the principal deposits placed within its strategic stablecoins.

      It is designed to function like a <u>universal liquidity pool</u> for all assets that underly reflect based strategies, allowing for feeless rebalancing across strategies with no slippage, mev or vampiric loss. Liquidity is added to this pool via the use of Restaking, a network-security primitive that allows proof-of-stake assets to be reused in the validation of alternative services.

      Restaking is used to enable consensus based automation on Reflect Strategy Programs for example, when restaked nodes come to consensus that one strategy is missing X dollars, then we can automatically refill this deposit to ensure minimal collateral downtime. \_This system is up to 4000x more efficient than human operated strategy rebalancing. \_

      The claims process is entirely automated thanks to the above consensus system, meaning depositors and developers need not to worry about prinicpal deposits and can instead maximise their choice of strategy in return for yield.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Active risk prevention through consensus based insurance

**Reflect Money actively prevents risk events facing its collateral** via <u>autonomous consensus</u> - _this can otherwise be described as groups of authorized nodes who are operating a software-based data collection service_ that aids in identifying the moments an insurance claim is needed. Once these nodes agree that a claim is required they can automatically run this process on-chain, ensuring minimal collateral downtime and the smallest possible losses.

  <Card title="Powered by Restaking" icon="spa" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    Reflect(s) Global Insurance pool is powered by Restaked Assets. Allowing users to secure their Layer-1 blockchain by staking & earn real-time cash income by securing stablecoins.

  <Card title="Automated by Consensus" icon="gear" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    To maximise transparency and minimise insurance pool losses all claims are handled through consensus nodes with access to all data relevant to Reflect strategies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Attestations in Real Time" icon="clock" img="/images/docs-bar.png">
    Insurance nodes post public attestations every 450 miliseconds of all data they have collected and the calculated risk score and claims status. This allows for developers and users to model risk in realtime.
