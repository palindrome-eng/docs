Aurora is an Autonomous Risk Monitoring Service (aRMS) with Generative Risk Scores that are algorithmically calculated and posted onchain. It is designed to systematically archive and index onchain data points that are relevant to the operational and economic security of the Reflect Delta-Neutral Protocol. 

### Bringing risk management onchain with Aurora.

Aurora v0 introduces a first-in-industry Autonomous Risk Monitoring Service for Delta-Neutral Protocols that is deeply integrated with its onchain program. 

The node collects tens of thousands of data points daily, analysing these with complex risk scoring models that are then automatically posted onchain similar to how oracles post prices. The Reflect Program is then able to react to the perceived risk to collateral with things like insurance claims without the need for governance.

### Systematic solutions to risk powered by Aurora.

  <Card title="Hyperspeed Data Collection" icon="eye">
    Aurora collects data as fast as it is posted to Solana providing an edge in onchain risk management efficiency.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Algorithmic Risk Scoring" icon="star-half-stroke">
    Aurora uses proprietary risk scoring models derived from onchain data.

  <Card title="Risk Oracles" icon="bolt">
    Aurora posts Risk Scores onchain along with their scoring model. This is used in the Reflect Program.

### The AuroraRMS Development Stack.

Aurora uses a majority Rust development stack with the introduction of PostgreSQL:

<Steps>
  <Step title="The Rust Programming Language" icon="rust">
    Rust is used in the operation of an **actix-web** based server with **tokio** asynchronous runtime. **sqlx** connects the server to the database and manages database functionality.
  </Step>
  <Step title="PostgreSQL" icon="database">
    PostgreSQL's advanced indexing and efficient query execution, combined with Rust's concurrency model, enable ultra-fast data storage and retrieval, making it ideal for high-performance risk monitoring.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Anchor - Sealevel Framework" icon="anchor">
    **anchor-lang** is used to develop the onchain binaries for hosting oracle posted data in a verifiable way.
  </Step>
</Steps>
