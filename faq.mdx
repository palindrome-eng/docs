  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Reflect issue its own stablecoins?" icon="question">
    **No, Reflect does not issue its own stablecoins** - instead Reflect issues interest-generating versions of existing trusted assets or aggregated baskets of them.

  <Accordion title="Where does the interest come from?" icon="question">
    **Reflect primarily generates interest through onchain strategies** that maximise the capital efficiency of an asset. The interest-generation strategy for each asset is specific to providing the lowest risk returns for its available markets. 

    More details can be found within the specific stablecoin documents page.

  <Accordion title="Is it safe to deposit assets to Reflect?" icon="Question">
    Reflect uses verifiable, onchain programs to manage its deposited assets - **these programs have been and continue to be rigorously audited** by industry-leading security firms helping to minimise risk.

    However, there are inherent risks to using onchain finance and self-custody that you should understand before using our application.
