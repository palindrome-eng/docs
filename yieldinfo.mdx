## Introduction to Decentralized Yield Generation

Reflect Protocol builds on-top of the interest bearing 'Liquid Staking Token (LST)' primitive tied directly to **Proof of Stake Rewards, Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and Priority Fees** generated by 

Reflect Protocol deems this as - **Native Yield** and combines it with **Delta-Neutral Hedging** to remove Solana (SOL) volatility.

## What is Native Yield?

Native Yield in an extended definition is Interest generated from the operation and economic security of the blockchain itself. Validators and Stakers earn a percentage of total network revenues diversified into different streams as outlined _below._

    Staking on Solana involves locking up your SOL tokens to support the network's security and operations. In return for staking your tokens, you earn a native yield, which is a portion of the rewards generated by the network.

    By operating a Jito Network enabled client the Reflect Validator generates additional returns through the distribution of MEV tips paid by advanced onchain traders.

  <Card title="Priority Fees" icon="hand-holding-dollar" href="https://solana.com/docs/core/fees">
    Priority Fees are the additional lamports sent by transaction submitters as an incentive for inclusion within a block. Validators aim to make the most economically positive blocks within the bounds of their ordering system to generate additional yield.

## What is Delta-Neutral Hedging?

Delta-neutral hedging is a strategy that aims to balance positive and negative price movements in related assets, making the overall portfolio resistant to price changes of any magnitude. It involves taking offsetting positions in different but correlated instruments. For example, holding a cryptocurrency while simultaneously shorting an equivalent amount of futures on that same crypto. This approach allows investors to profit from other factors (like funding rates or yield) while effectively neutralizing exposure to price fluctuations in the underlying asset, whether small or large.

### How does Funding Rate income/payments work?

Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders in perpetual futures markets. When the majority of traders are long, they pay a small fee to short traders, and vice versa. This mechanism helps keep the futures price aligned with the spot price. Traders can earn income by taking the less popular side of the trade, receiving payments from the dominant side. However, they also risk paying if market sentiment shifts.

<Info>
  Funding Rates can vary between Decentralized Exchanges depending on Open Interest, TVL and the Algorithm used to determine the end number.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<br />

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is Reflect's APY (%) Variable or Fixed Rate?" icon="circle-question">
    **Variable**, Due to the fluctuations in yield generated natively and via hedging the actual received amount can move over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is yield generated by Reflect sustainable?" icon="circle-question">
    **Yes**, up to 8% of APY is generated through Proof-of-Stake SOL. Additionally consider the speculative nature of Cryocurrency assets and the long-tail demand for leverage increasing as adoption grows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can i expect to have losses on my deposits?" icon="circle-question">
    **No.** Reflect Protocol is 100% principle protected via the use of multiple innovative insurance mechanisms. Insurance stakers uptake the risk that otherwise users would be faced with.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if the perpetuals funding rate is negative?" icon="circle-question">
    Funding Rate negativity can be sustained at a ratio of -8% APY per year naturally without the need for additional insurance due to the nature of the collateral having native yield. However - Funding Rate losses are designed to be rectified via Insurance Fund Claims.
